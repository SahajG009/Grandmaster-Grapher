# ‚ôõ Grandmaster Grapher ‚ôö

## Project Overview

The Grandmaster Grapher project is a dynamic and visually appealing tool designed to scrape live world rankings and performance metrics of the top 10 chess players from 2700chess.com. The project leverages web scraping techniques to gather real-time data, saves it in a CSV format, and visualizes it in an insightful graph using Matplotlib.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Installation

Make sure you have the required Python libraries installed:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 matplotlib
```

### Usage

1. **Run the Script:**
   Execute the Python script to scrape live data, save it in CSV format, and generate the graph.

   ```bash
   python grandmaster grapher.py
   ```

2. **Explore the Results:**
   Open the generated `chess_ratings.csv` file to explore the collected data. The graph will also be displayed to provide a visual representation of the top 10 chess players' rankings and ratings.

## üõ† Implementation

The project utilizes the following Python libraries:

- **Requests:** For sending HTTP requests and retrieving webpage content.
- **BeautifulSoup:** To parse and extract relevant data from the HTML structure.
- **Matplotlib:** For creating graphical visualizations of the collected data.
- **CSV:** Handling data storage in CSV format.

## üìä Graphical Visualization

The generated graph displays the following information for each player:

- **Ranking:** Current world ranking.
- **Name:** Player's name.
- **Classical Rating:** Player's rating in classical time control.
- **Rapid Rating:** Player's rating in rapid time control.
- **Blitz Rating:** Player's rating in blitz time control.

## üåê Data Source

Data is scraped in real-time from [2700chess.com](https://2700chess.com/), a popular chess statistics website.
